Python Capstone4:
Lists, Functions, and String Handling

In the previous Capstone project3, I created a simple task management system
that stored data in text files. In this project, I use lists or dictionaries and
functions to extend the functionality of the previous Capstone Project.


I had to modify the code of the previous project so that functions are used.


Adding functions improves the modularity of the code. 


My program included the following functions:

o reg_user — that is called when the user selects ‘ r ’ to register a user.

o add_task — that is called when a user selects ‘ a ’ to add a new task.

o view_all — that is called when users type ‘va’ to view all the tasks listed in ‘tasks.txt’.

o view_mine — that is called when users type ‘vm’ to view all the tasks that have been assigned to them.



The admininistrator is able to:
1 - generate statistics 
2 - generate reports 

With the data on this task management system and there are functions coded for both
